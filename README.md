# Customer-Churn-Prediction

The advancement in the world of machine learning techniques has brought powerful tools that 
have revolutionized customer churn predictions for anticipation of customer attrition. Machine 
learning algorithms can use the learning patterns from past/historical data and make predictions 
on future data. By leveraging historical data, including demographic information, transaction 
records, and behavioral insights, machine learning algorithms can help forecast the likelihood of 
customer churn with remarkable accuracy. Customer churn significance transcends industries, 
impacting businesses in banking and finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. Aside from the major 
disadvantage of customer churn, which is revenue loss, churn also undermines the companyâ€™s 
reputation. 

This research paper aims to predict customer churn rates using real-world customer churn dataset 
and compare the performance of various machine learning classifiers for optimized prediction 
accuracies. KNIME open-source tool was used, and the classifiers used in this study are decision 
tree, random forest, neural network, and logistic regression.   
The paper is structured to provide an organized comprehensive understanding of the customer 
churn prediction processes. The CRISP-DM approach was used for the analysis which commenced 
with the business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, model building, selection, 
and evaluation methodologies, all culminated in a detailed analysis of results and actionable 
insights for mitigating customer churn.  

By harnessing the predictive capabilities of machine learning, businesses can proactively address 
customer attrition, safeguard revenue streams, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction. This 
paper contributes valuable insights to strategic decision-making processes, empowering businesses 
to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.
